<p>Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license<br>document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<h2 id="Preamble"><a href="#Preamble" class="headerlink" title="Preamble"></a>Preamble</h2><p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other<br>kinds of works.</p>
<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away<br>your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a<br>program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free<br>Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it<br>applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to<br>your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General<br>Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute<br>copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source<br>code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of<br>it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or<br>asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if<br>you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to<br>respect the freedom of others.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,<br>you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make<br>sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these<br>terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert<br>copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission<br>to copy, distribute and&#x2F;or modify it.</p>
<p>For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is<br>no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL<br>requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not<br>be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.</p>
<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of<br>the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally<br>incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The<br>systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed<br>this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems<br>arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to<br>those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of<br>users.</p>
<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should<br>not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose<br>computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents<br>applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the<br>GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>
<h2 id="TERMS-AND-CONDITIONS"><a href="#TERMS-AND-CONDITIONS" class="headerlink" title="TERMS AND CONDITIONS"></a>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2><h3 id="0-Definitions"><a href="#0-Definitions" class="headerlink" title="0. Definitions."></a>0. Definitions.</h3><p>&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>License. Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;. &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and<br>&ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.</p>
<p>To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in<br>a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The<br>resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of the earlier work or a<br>work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based on<br>the Program.</p>
<p>To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under<br>applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private<br>copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),<br>making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
<p>To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer<br>network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
<p>An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal Notices&rdquo; to the<br>extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)<br>displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no<br>warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that<br>licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this<br>License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>
<h3 id="1-Source-Code"><a href="#1-Source-Code" class="headerlink" title="1. Source Code."></a>1. Source Code.</h3><p>The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>making modifications to it. &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source form of a<br>work.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an official<br>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces<br>specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among<br>developers working in that language.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other than<br>the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major<br>Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to<br>enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard<br>Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.<br>A &ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential component<br>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which<br>the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code<br>interpreter used to run it.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means all the<br>source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object<br>code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However,<br>it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or<br>generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those<br>activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source<br>includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and<br>the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work<br>is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or<br>control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate<br>automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.</p>
<h3 id="2-Basic-Permissions"><a href="#2-Basic-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="2. Basic Permissions."></a>2. Basic Permissions.</h3><p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the<br>Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License<br>explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The<br>output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,<br>given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights<br>of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>
<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without<br>conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered<br>works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively<br>for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you<br>comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not<br>control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so<br>exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit<br>them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship<br>with you.</p>
<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions<br>stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.</p>
<h3 id="3-Protecting-Users’-Legal-Rights-From-Anti-Circumvention-Law"><a href="#3-Protecting-Users’-Legal-Rights-From-Anti-Circumvention-Law" class="headerlink" title="3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law."></a>3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h3><p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any<br>applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty<br>adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention<br>of such measures.</p>
<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of<br>technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising<br>rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any<br>intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,<br>against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention<br>of technological measures.</p>
<h3 id="4-Conveying-Verbatim-Copies"><a href="#4-Conveying-Verbatim-Copies" class="headerlink" title="4. Conveying Verbatim Copies."></a>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h3><p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any<br>medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and<br>any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep<br>intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of<br>this License along with the Program.</p>
<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer<br>support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>
<h3 id="5-Conveying-Modified-Source-Versions"><a href="#5-Conveying-Modified-Source-Versions" class="headerlink" title="5. Conveying Modified Source Versions."></a>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h3><p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from<br>the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that<br>you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a)</strong> The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a<br>relevant date.</li>
<li><strong>b)</strong> The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this<br>License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the<br>requirement in section 4 to &ldquo;keep intact all notices&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>c)</strong> You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who<br>comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any<br>applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the<br>work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have<br>separately received it.</li>
<li><strong>d)</strong> If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal<br>Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display<br>Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are<br>not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with<br>it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution<br>medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting<br>copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users<br>beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate<br>does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.</p>
<h3 id="6-Conveying-Non-Source-Forms"><a href="#6-Conveying-Non-Source-Forms" class="headerlink" title="6. Conveying Non-Source Forms."></a>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h3><p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and<br>5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the<br>terms of this License, in one of these ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a)</strong> Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a<br>physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a<br>durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.</li>
<li><strong>b)</strong> Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a<br>physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least<br>three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for<br>that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of<br>the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this<br>License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for<br>a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of<br>source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no<br>charge.</li>
<li><strong>c)</strong> Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to<br>provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and<br>noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in<br>accord with subsection 6b.</li>
<li><strong>d)</strong> Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for<br>a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way<br>through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy<br>the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object<br>code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server<br>(operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities,<br>provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find<br>the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,<br>you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy<br>these requirements.</li>
<li><strong>e)</strong> Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform<br>other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being<br>offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.</li>
</ul>
<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the<br>Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the<br>object code work.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which<br>means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or<br>household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a<br>dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases<br>shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a<br>particular user, &ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a typical or common use of<br>that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way<br>in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the<br>product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has<br>substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,<br>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute<br>modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of<br>its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued<br>functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with<br>solely because modification has been made.</p>
<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for<br>use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which<br>the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient<br>in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is<br>characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be<br>accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if<br>neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code<br>on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).</p>
<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to<br>continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been<br>modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been<br>modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself<br>materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules<br>and protocols for communication across the network.</p>
<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with<br>this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an<br>implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no<br>special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.</p>
<h3 id="7-Additional-Terms"><a href="#7-Additional-Terms" class="headerlink" title="7. Additional Terms."></a>7. Additional Terms.</h3><p>&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional<br>permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they<br>were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable<br>law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be<br>used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>
<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any<br>additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional<br>permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you<br>modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a<br>covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a<br>covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)<br>supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a)</strong> Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of<br>sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>
<li><strong>b)</strong> Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author<br>attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works<br>containing it; or</li>
<li><strong>c)</strong> Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that<br>modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the<br>original version; or</li>
<li><strong>d)</strong> Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the<br>material; or</li>
<li><strong>e)</strong> Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,<br>trademarks, or service marks; or</li>
<li><strong>f)</strong> Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone<br>who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of<br>liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions<br>directly impose on those licensors and authors.</li>
</ul>
<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &ldquo;further<br>restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received<br>it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License<br>along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a<br>license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying<br>under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of<br>that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such<br>relicensing or conveying.</p>
<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in<br>the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those<br>files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.</p>
<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a<br>separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply<br>either way.</p>
<h3 id="8-Termination"><a href="#8-Termination" class="headerlink" title="8. Termination."></a>8. Termination.</h3><p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under<br>this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will<br>automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses<br>granted under the third paragraph of section 11).</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a<br>particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the<br>copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently,<br>if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently<br>if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this<br>is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any<br>work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of<br>parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your<br>rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to<br>receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.</p>
<h3 id="9-Acceptance-Not-Required-for-Having-Copies"><a href="#9-Acceptance-Not-Required-for-Having-Copies" class="headerlink" title="9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies."></a>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h3><p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the<br>Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of<br>using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require<br>acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to<br>propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not<br>accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you<br>indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>
<h3 id="10-Automatic-Licensing-of-Downstream-Recipients"><a href="#10-Automatic-Licensing-of-Downstream-Recipients" class="headerlink" title="10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients."></a>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h3><p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license<br>from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this<br>License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this<br>License.</p>
<p>An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control of an<br>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or<br>merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity<br>transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also<br>receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or<br>could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor<br>has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>
<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or<br>affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty,<br>or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not<br>initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging<br>that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or<br>importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>
<h3 id="11-Patents"><a href="#11-Patents" class="headerlink" title="11. Patents."></a>11. Patents.</h3><p>A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus<br>licensed is called the contributor’s &ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A contributor’s &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims owned or<br>controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that<br>would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or<br>selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed<br>only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For<br>purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant patent<br>sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.</p>
<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license<br>under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale,<br>import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor<br>version.</p>
<p>In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any express<br>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an<br>express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent<br>infringement). To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a party means to make<br>such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.</p>
<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the<br>Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge<br>and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or<br>other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding<br>Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with<br>the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream<br>recipients. &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have actual knowledge that, but<br>for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your<br>recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more<br>identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you<br>convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent<br>license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,<br>propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent<br>license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and<br>works based on it.</p>
<p>A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include within the<br>scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the<br>non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this<br>License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with<br>a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make<br>payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the<br>work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive<br>the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with<br>copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b)<br>primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain<br>the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license<br>was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>
<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied<br>license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you<br>under applicable patent law.</p>

No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.</h3><p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)<br>that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the<br>conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy<br>simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent<br>obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you<br>agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from<br>those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms<br>and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>
<h3 id="13-Use-with-the-GNU-Affero-General-Public-License"><a href="#13-Use-with-the-GNU-Affero-General-Public-License" class="headerlink" title="13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License."></a>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h3><p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or<br>combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero<br>General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.<br>The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered<br>work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section<br>13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.</p>
<h3 id="14-Revised-Versions-of-this-License"><a href="#14-Revised-Versions-of-this-License" class="headerlink" title="14. Revised Versions of this License."></a>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h3><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and&#x2F;or new versions of the GNU<br>General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit<br>to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that<br>a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License &ldquo;or any later<br>version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the<br>Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU<br>General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free<br>Software Foundation.</p>
<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU<br>General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a<br>version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.</p>
<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no<br>additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of<br>your choosing to follow a later version.</p>
<h3 id="15-Disclaimer-of-Warranty"><a href="#15-Disclaimer-of-Warranty" class="headerlink" title="15. Disclaimer of Warranty."></a>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h3><p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND&#x2F;OR OTHER PARTIES<br>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER<br>EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE<br>QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE<br>DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<h3 id="16-Limitation-of-Liability"><a href="#16-Limitation-of-Liability" class="headerlink" title="16. Limitation of Liability."></a>16. Limitation of Liability.</h3><p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY<br>COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND&#x2F;OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS<br>PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,<br>INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE<br>OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE<br>WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</h3><p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be<br>given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local<br>law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in<br>connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies<br>a copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Apply-These-Terms-to-Your-New-Programs"><a href="#How-to-Apply-These-Terms-to-Your-New-Programs" class="headerlink" title="How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs"></a>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h2><p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to<br>the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone<br>can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them<br>to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty;<br>and each file should have at least the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to<br>where the full notice is found.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this<br>when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>

<p>The hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’ should show the appropriate parts of<br>the General Public License. Of course, your program’s commands might be different;<br>for a GUI interface, you would use an &ldquo;about box&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to<br>sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the program, if necessary.

<p>The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it<br>more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.
